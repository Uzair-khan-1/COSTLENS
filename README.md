# CostLens — *From plans to price.* (MVP)

An AI-assisted, engineer-controlled tool that turns one or more simple
residential RCC drawings (PDF/PNG/JPG - e.g. separate Plan, Elevation, and
Section files) plus a few project inputs into a **preliminary** Material
Take-Off (MTO), Bill of Quantities (BOQ), and cost estimate — exportable to
Excel and PDF.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This tool produces **preliminary, indicative**
> quantities and costs for early-stage budgeting only. It is **not** a
> substitute for a licensed structural engineer's design, a detailed BOQ
> prepared from approved drawings, or a certified quantity surveyor's
> estimate. Always get professional verification before using these
> numbers for tendering, construction, or financial decisions.

## 0. Branding

The app is styled as **CostLens** (tagline: *"From plans to price."*). All
visual polish is done within plain Streamlit's platform limits - no custom
JS framework, no React components:

- **Native theme** (`.streamlit/config.toml`) sets the base color palette
  (navy text, teal accent, light background) using Streamlit's own
  `[theme]` keys, so it applies before a single line of the app runs.
- **CSS injection** (`ui/theme.py`, `inject_theme()`) layers the "Outfit"
  Google Font, a gradient hero banner, styled buttons/metric-cards/
  expanders, and a branded sidebar - all via `st.markdown(unsafe_allow_html=True)`
  targeting stable `data-testid` selectors, so it degrades gracefully
  instead of breaking if a future Streamlit version renames a CSS class.
- **`st.logo()`** (guarded with `hasattr(st, "logo")` for older Streamlit
  versions) shows the horizontal logo lockup in the sidebar header.
- **Logo assets** (`assets/costlens_icon.png`, `assets/costlens_logo.png`)
  are generated entirely with Pillow - see `assets/generate_logo.py` if you
  ever want to tweak the mark or regenerate it at a different size.

## 1. Why this architecture

The single most important design decision in this project:

**The LLM (Groq) never calculates final quantities.**

Vision-language models are good at *reading* a drawing — spotting a grid of
columns, guessing a slab thickness note, reading a dimension string — but
they are unreliable at *arithmetic* and have no memory of engineering
formulas. So this app splits the pipeline in two:

1. **AI interpretation layer** (`ai/`) — Groq's vision-capable LLM looks at
   the drawing image(s) plus any OCR'd text and returns a **structured JSON**
   guess of building parameters (floors, footing type, column count/size,
   beam count/size, slab area/thickness, wall length, openings, etc.),
   each with a **confidence level** (High/Medium/Low) and a short reason.
2. **Deterministic engineering layer** (`engineering/`) — plain Python
   functions implement standard civil-engineering thumb-rule formulas
   (excavation volume, concrete volume, steel-by-thumb-rule, formwork
   contact area, masonry/plaster area, etc.). These functions are pure,
   unit-tested-friendly, and 100% traceable — every number in the final
   BOQ can be traced back to an input parameter and a named formula.

Between steps 1 and 2 sits a **mandatory human-in-the-loop review screen**:
the user sees every AI-extracted parameter, its confidence level, and can
edit any value before a single quantity is calculated. Nothing the LLM says
is trusted blindly.

## 2. What's included in the MVP

Supports simple **1–2 storey RCC residential buildings** (isolated footings,
rectangular columns, rectangular beams, flat RCC slabs, brick/block infill
walls) and estimates:

- Earthwork excavation to founding depth + PCC (incl. working-space allowance),
  backfilling around footings, and earth filling in the plinth
- Anti-termite treatment & PCC (lean concrete) below footings
- Footing concrete + reinforcement (footing *thickness* and *founding depth*
  are separate inputs)
- Column concrete + reinforcement (incl. the below-ground stub from top of
  footing to ground level)
- Beam concrete + reinforcement (beam depth below the slab only at slab
  levels, so the slab/beam overlap is not double-counted)
- Slab concrete + reinforcement
- Staircase (RCC dog-legged, per slab level incl. roof access) + reinforcement
- Lintels over all openings and chajjas (sunshades) over windows + reinforcement
- Ground-floor base: brick soling + PCC floor base
- Formwork/shuttering contact area (footings, columns, beams, slabs, stairs, lintels)
- Masonry / blockwork: units, mortar (both material) and laying labour,
  openings and lintels deducted, roof parapet added
- Plaster: internal walls, external walls (split using the external
  perimeter) and ceilings, openings deducted
- Flooring (built-up area allowance)
- Roof waterproofing + roof insulation/tiles (mud fill + brick/tuff tiles)
- Painting (internal walls, external walls, ceilings - tied to plaster areas)
- DPC (damp-proof course) at plinth level
- Parametric MEP allowances: electrical works (per m² covered area),
  bathroom plumbing & sanitary (per bathroom), kitchen (per kitchen),
  external water supply & drainage (per house)
- Doors & windows (supply + installation, priced per door / per m² of
  window area, scaled by Finish Level)
- **Cement bags, sand, and aggregate/crush quantities** for every concrete
  pour and every mortar (masonry + plaster) - see section 3d below
- Preliminary reinforcement **allowance** as a % check against thumb-rule
  steel (sanity cross-check, flagged if they diverge a lot)
- "Preliminaries & site overheads" and "Contingency" (both %-based, editable in Step 5)
- Concrete-grade-aware pricing: RCC rates are priced at M20 and PCC at M10;
  other grades adjust the rate by the cement/sand/aggregate cost difference
- Steel-grade-aware quantities: thumb-rule steel is scaled by a (partial)
  grade factor - Grade 40 needs more steel, Grade 75 slightly less
- Input sanity checks before calculation (impossible inputs block the
  calculation; unusual ones are flagged)

Every quantity row carries: **formula name, inputs used, confidence,
assumption notes**, visible in an expandable "Calculation Breakdown" panel.

### Explicitly out of scope for this MVP (documented, not silently dropped)
- Detailed structural design / bar bending schedules
- Detailed MEP design / MEP quantity take-off (points, pipe runs) and HVAC —
  MEP is priced as parametric allowances only (see above)
- Boundary wall, main gate, landscaping, solar/UPS
- Non-RCC structural systems (steel frame, load-bearing masonry without RCC
  frame, sloped/truss roofs)
- Multi-wing / irregular floor plans beyond basic rectangle decomposition
- Seismic/wind design checks

## 3a. Units & currency

The app always **calculates internally in SI/metric units** (m, m², m³, kg) -
that never changes. What the user sees is controlled by a per-project
**Unit System** toggle in Step 1:

- **SI (Metric)** - dimensions entered/shown in metres, m², m³.
- **FPS (Feet-Inch, Pakistani practice)** - dimensions entered/shown in feet
  (lengths/heights), inches (slab/wall thickness, column & beam
  cross-sections - matching how these are conventionally quoted on-site),
  square feet (areas) and cubic feet (concrete/excavation quantities in the
  MTO/BOQ). Steel is always quoted/priced in **kg** in either system, since
  that's how it's bought in Pakistan regardless of which system the rest of
  the job is measured in.

Switching the toggle never changes a single underlying number or the final
cost - it only changes how values are displayed and entered. The rate-book
editor (Step 5) shows/accepts rates per cft or sqft when FPS is selected,
but stores them internally per m³/m² so the BOQ math is identical either
way (see `utils/units.py` for the conversion functions and the invariant
this relies on: `display_quantity × display_rate == amount`, always).

The default rate book (`data/material_rates.json`) is priced in **PKR**,
built from published September-2026 Pakistani market prices for cement,
Grade-60 steel, sand, crush/bajri, bricks, plaster and paint, combined with
standard nominal-mix/dry-volume-factor quantities and typical site labour
allowances (see the `note` field in that file for the full breakdown). As
with everything else in this app, these are **indicative defaults only** -
always override them with your own current, local quotations before
relying on the cost estimate.

---

## 3b. Multi-file drawing upload (Plan / Elevation / Section)

Step 1 accepts up to `config.MAX_DRAWING_FILES` (default 3) separate
drawing files, each taggable as Plan / Elevation / Section / Other. This
matters because a Plan view is a horizontal slice - it cannot show vertical
dimensions at all. Adding a Section lets the AI actually read floor-to-floor
height, footing depth, and slab thickness instead of guessing defaults for
them; an Elevation is a good cross-check for floor count and overall height.
The tag you pick is passed straight into the AI prompt ("Image 1 = Plan,
Image 2 = Section, ...") so the model knows which kind of dimension to
expect from which image.

To stay within Groq's limits, pages/images are capped at
`config.MAX_PAGES_PER_FILE` (default 2) per file and `config.MAX_TOTAL_IMAGES`
(3) in total across every uploaded file - Groq's current vision model,
`qwen/qwen3.8-27b`, accepts at most 3 images per request, and larger requests
are rejected. Extra pages/files beyond the caps are dropped with an on-screen
notice, never a crash.

For vector PDFs (exported from CAD), the PDF's embedded text layer -
dimension strings, notes, schedules - is also passed to the AI as a hint.
This is exact text, far more reliable than reading small raster text.

---

## 3c. Finish Level

The **Finish Level** selector (Step 1: Basic / Standard / Premium) is wired
to the BOQ, not just cosmetic. It never changes a quantity - the same
floor area still gets floored, the same wall area still gets
plastered/painted - it only changes the *rate* applied to the
finish-grade-sensitive categories: **Flooring, Painting, and Plaster**.
Everything else (concrete, steel, excavation, masonry, formwork, etc.) is
unaffected, since finish grade has no bearing on structural work.

`engineering/rules.py::FINISH_LEVEL_RATE_MULTIPLIERS` holds the multipliers
(Standard = 1.00x, matching the rate book's own default rates), derived
from researched September-2026 Pakistani market price spreads for economy
vs. mid-range vs. premium tile, paint, plaster, door, and window finishes.
`Standard` is always the rate book's rate un-modified; `Basic`/`Premium`
scale it up or down. The finish-sensitive categories are Flooring, Painting,
Plaster, Doors, Windows, Electrical, Plumbing & Sanitary and Kitchen. Step 5's BOQ table shows the adjusted rate/amount
directly, and each affected line's Remarks column notes the multiplier
that was applied.

---

## 3d. Procurement quantities: cement, sand, aggregate/crush, doors & windows

The MTO (Step 4) is built to be handed to a supplier, not just a cost
engine's internal working. Two refinements make that possible:

**Cement / sand / aggregate breakdown.** Every concrete pour (PCC,
footings, columns, beams, slabs, DPC) and every cement:sand mortar
(masonry bedding/jointing, internal + external plaster) gets its own
cement-bags / sand-volume / aggregate-volume breakdown immediately below
it in the MTO table, using the standard nominal-mix + dry-volume-factor
method (`engineering/calculations.py::concrete_material_breakdown()` /
`mortar_material_breakdown()`). A project-wide `SUMMARY-CEMENT` /
`SUMMARY-SAND` / `SUMMARY-AGG` rollup (and a "📦 Procurement summary"
metrics row at the top of Step 4) gives the one number that actually goes
to a cement/sand supplier.

These breakdown rows are marked `informational` and **excluded from BOQ
pricing** - their cost is already inside the parent item's composite rate
(e.g. `FTG-CONC-01`'s PKR/m3 rate already covers its own cement, sand,
aggregate, and labour), so pricing them again would double-count the cost.
They're still fully visible in the MTO (Step 4) and in the exported MTO
sheet/section - a checkbox on Step 4 lets you hide them from the on-screen
table if you just want the main structural/finish rows, but they're always
counted in the metrics row and export.

Figures are **net theoretical requirements** - no site wastage/spillage
margin is added, since Step 5's wastage % only applies to priced BOQ
items. Add your own margin when actually ordering (commonly 3-5% for
cement, 5-10% for sand/aggregate).

**Doors & windows.** Previously, door/window count and area were only used
to deduct wall-opening area from the masonry/plaster take-off - they were
never priced. Doors are now a real BOQ line (`DOOR-01`, priced per door)
and windows another (`WINDOW-01`, priced per m² of window area, since
window cost scales with size unlike doors), both scaled by Finish Level
the same way flooring/painting/plaster are.

## 4. Local setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/mto-boq-estimator.git
cd mto-boq-estimator

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Get a **free** Groq API key at https://console.groq.com/keys and set it as
an environment variable (never commit it):

```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY="gsk_..."          # macOS/Linux
setx GROQ_API_KEY "gsk_..."            # Windows
```

Run the app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app also lets a user paste their own Groq API key into a sidebar field
at runtime (kept only in session memory, and used in preference to the
deployment's key) — handy for a shared public demo deployment where you don't
want to spend your own key/quota.

The vision model defaults to `qwen/qwen3.8-27b` with `qwen/qwen3.6-27b`
(deprecated by Groq) as a fallback. When Groq retires a model, set
`GROQ_VISION_MODEL` / `GROQ_VISION_MODEL_FALLBACK` as a secret or environment
variable - no code change needed. Transient errors (429/5xx) are retried with
backoff.

Run the tests:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest
```

## 5. Deployment (100% free stack)

See **`DEPLOYMENT.md`** for the full step-by-step guide to:
1. Push this project to GitHub
2. Deploy on Streamlit Community Cloud (free tier)
3. Configure the `GROQ_API_KEY` secret
4. Common troubleshooting (package sizes, EasyOCR model downloads, etc.)

---

## 6. Engineering assumptions & thumb rules used

All defaults live in `engineering/rules.py` (mirrored in
`data/default_assumptions.json`). The steel thumb rules, PCC thickness, plinth
height, excavation working space and parapet height are **editable in Step 3**
("Engineering assumptions"); rates, wastage, preliminaries and contingency are
editable in Step 5. Key thumb rules (typical South Asian - Pakistani/Indian -
residential RCC practice, adjust per local code/practice):

| Item | Thumb rule | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Founding depth | 1.5 m (default) | ground level to underside of footing - drives excavation |
| Footing thickness | 0.45 m (default) | pad thickness - drives footing concrete |
| Footing steel | 60–100 kg/m³ of footing concrete | isolated footing, editable |
| Column steel | 140–200 kg/m³ of column concrete | incl. main bars + ties |
| Beam steel | 110–160 kg/m³ of beam concrete | |
| Slab steel | 70–100 kg/m³ of slab concrete | one-way/two-way not distinguished in MVP |
| Stair / lintel steel | 80–120 / 60–100 kg/m³ | editable |
| Steel grade factor | Grade 40 ×1.25, Grade 60 ×1.00, Grade 75 ×0.93 | partial scaling, indicative |
| Excavation working space | +150 mm each side of footing | for shuttering/working |
| PCC thickness | 75 mm (default) | below footings |
| Concrete wastage | 3–5% | editable |
| Steel wastage | 3–5% | editable |
| Block/brick wastage | 5% | editable |
| Brick count | wall volume ÷ nominal unit volume (incl. 10 mm joint) | 500/m³ modular, ~408/m³ 9"×4.5"×3" |
| Masonry mortar | wall volume − bricks × actual brick volume | ≈0.23 m³ wet mortar per m³ |
| Plaster thickness | 12 mm internal / 15–20 mm external | editable |
| Dry volume factor (wet→dry concrete) | 1.54 | standard factor for mix design qty |
| Dry volume factor (wet→dry mortar) | 1.33 | lower than concrete's - no coarse aggregate to bulk it up |
| Masonry mortar mix | 1:6 (cement:sand) | bedding/jointing |
| Plaster mortar mix | 1:4 (cement:sand) | internal & external |
| Cement bag / bulk density | 50 kg per bag @ 1440 kg/m³ loose | used to convert cement volume → bags |

These are **industry-typical preliminary/thumb-rule values**, not a
substitute for structural design. They are shown to the user with sources
in-app and are fully editable before the BOQ is generated.

## 8. Changelog

**v0.4.0**
- Fixed: footing thickness and founding depth were one field. Footing
  concrete was ~2x too high and excavation was too shallow. They are now
  separate inputs, with backfill, plinth filling and the below-ground column
  stub added.
- Fixed: brick count double-deducted mortar (~30% undercount). Masonry
  laying labour is now priced.
- Fixed: beam concrete double-counted the slab overlap at slab levels.
- Fixed: internal/external plaster split. Ceiling plaster and paint added.
- Added missing scope: staircase, lintels/chajjas, parapet, ground-floor
  soling + PCC base, roof insulation/tiles, parametric MEP.
- Fixed: Step 3 crash on unexpected AI footing types; AI free-text wall
  material no longer overrides the Step 1 choice; malformed AI fields fall
  back per field instead of discarding the whole extraction.
- Fixed: stale drawings analysed after re-upload; drawings kept when
  returning to Step 1.
- PDF text layer now sent to the AI. Steel grade and concrete grade now
  affect quantities/rates; steel grade SI/FPS equivalence corrected
  (Fe415 ≈ Grade 60).
- Input validation before calculation. Sidebar API key and editable
  engineering assumptions (as documented).
- Groq: `qwen/qwen3.8-27b` primary with fallback, 3-image cap, retries.
- BOQ auto-recalculates; exports cached; Excel BOQ uses live formulas.
- Pinned dependencies; deprecated Streamlit `use_container_width` removed.
- Range/benchmark regression tests (`tests/test_accuracy_and_regressions.py`).

## 9. Roadmap ideas (post-MVP)

- Bar Bending Schedule (BBS) generation
- Multi-drawing (plan + elevation + section) cross-referencing
- MEP quantity modules
- Region-specific rate books (state-wise DSR import)
